                [00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.720]   Okay.
                [00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.300]   So that you can send it to us in detail.
                [00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.640]   All right?
                [00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.720]   Okay, so you said to do what in detail?
                [00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.900]   You have to write a letter.
                [00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.500]   Okay.
                [00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:28.480]   So you indicated you did not have any proof that you are being overcharged by the driver.
                [00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:37.040]   And you also try to obtain the proof, but that was also not successful.
                [00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.640]   Then send in a proof to continue processing this dispute in writing.
                [00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:54.940]   Okay, send us a letter and mention everything in detail, what happened and how you felt exploited by the vendor when he charged you $300.
                [00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.020]   And as you felt that the only charged you.
                [00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.700]   supposed to pay for was not more than, more than $50 or whatever amount you feel that
                [00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.180]   was, that should be the actual charge.
                [00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.380]   Just mention that amount, okay?
                [00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.060]   Okay.
                [00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.700]   And send it to our dispute's address.
                [00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.060]   Please make a note of it.
                [00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.420]   Okay.
                [00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.300]   And.
                [00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:25.620]   And you did say that you were going to mail me something that I needed to write that on and then mail it back, right?
                [00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.000]   First, you will have to send.
                [00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.500]   this to us because initially, as we don't have any sales receipt, so we need something
                [00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.760]   from our end to show the merchant's bank that this is the reason why we are filing a dispute
                [00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.760]   against the merchant.
                [00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:50.340]   So the letter that we will receive from your end on the basis of that letter, we will go
                [00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.320]   to the merchant's bank so that letter, we'll take a copy of your letter sent by you.
                [00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.920]   We will show that letter to the merchant's bank and will tell the merchant's bank.
                [00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.960]   and we'll tell the merchant's bank that on the basis of this letter or on the basis of this
                [00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.320]   information that we have received from our customer, we have disputed the charge against
                [00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.000]   the merchant.
                [00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.080]   Okay.
                [00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.500]   Okay, because without any proof, even the merchant's bank will not allow us to take the money
                [00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.900]   in order to give you a conditional credit.
                [00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.100]   So we need something to show to the merchant's bank.
                [00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.920]   That's the reason I'm requesting you to send a letter to us, stating the, uh, stating the, uh,
                [00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.900]   stating the, uh,
                [00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.360]   information, what happened with you and how and what you felt when, when the driver asked
                [00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.560]   for $300, okay?
                [00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.240]   Mention everything in detail in that letter and send it to us.
                [00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.980]   Okay.
                [00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.240]   I understand.
                [00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.860]   Um, I have one more question.
                [00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.940]   Do I need to have that letter notarized?
                [00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.180]   No, no, not at all.
                [00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.600]   It's not required.
                [00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.120]   You just have to, uh, write it down, send it to us in a plain envelope on the envelope, on the
                [00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.480]   envelope.
                [00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.020]   just write the address, which I will give an in the body of that letter.
                [00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.240]   You will have to mention the case ID number.
                [00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.780]   I will provide you the case ID number also.
                [00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.040]   You can make a note of everything.
                [00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.060]   First, let's start with the address.
                [00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.180]   Okay.
                [00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.100]   On top, you will mention you will address it to Citibank.
                [00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.380]   And the address is P.O. Box.
                [00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.620]   6.113.

                [00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.720]   Okay.

                [00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:02.320]   August 12, 1968. And while you're looking that up, let me tell you that your website is absolutely useless. I tried to handle this online and couldn't even log in!
                [00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:12.640]   Thank you for that information, Mr. Johnson. I see your policy here. Could you tell me the date of the payment in question?
                [00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:22.880]   October 15th. $157.42. Like I said, it's right here on my bank statement. How do you people lose a payment that was automatically deducted?
                [00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:32.320]   I understand your concern. I'm looking at our payment history now. Would you be able to provide the transaction ID from your bank statement?
                [00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:45.760]   Are you kidding me? I gave this number to the last THREE people! It's SFB1592487. I wrote it down because I knew someone would ask for it AGAIN.
                [00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:55.440]   Thank you for having that ready, Mr. Johnson. I'm showing a pending transaction with that ID, but it seems there might be a processing delay with our bank.
                [00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:10.880]   A processing delay? For THREE WEEKS? This is absolutely unacceptable! And let me tell you something else - I've had to take time off work FOUR times now to deal with this!
                [00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:20.320]   I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Johnson. Let me access our payment processing system to get more details.
                [00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:35.640]   While you're doing that, let me tell you about the late fees I'm getting charged. LATE FEES! When the money left my account! This is highway robbery!
                [00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:45.280]   I can certainly help address those late fees, Mr. Johnson. Could you confirm the amount of the late fees you're seeing?
                [00:02:45.280 --> 00:03:05.440]   $25! Twenty-five dollars because YOU people can't process a payment properly! And that's not even counting the overdraft fee I got hit with when you tried to pull another payment this month!
                [00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:15.680]   I apologize for that inconvenience. I can definitely look into removing those fees. Could you tell me about the overdraft charge?
                [00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:35.240]   The bank charged me $34 because you tried to withdraw another payment when the first one hadn't even cleared! Who's going to reimburse me for that? And the hours I've spent on the phone?
                [00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:45.520]   Let me look into our double payment prevention protocols. This shouldn't have happened. May I put you on a brief hold while I check something?
                [00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:55.840]   Fine. But don't leave me hanging for 20 minutes like the last person did!
                [00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:05.120]   I assure you it will just be 2-3 minutes, Mr. Johnson. I'll be right back.
                [00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:35.360]   [Hold music plays]
                [00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:45.680]   Thank you for your patience, Mr. Johnson. I've found some information about the original transaction.
                [00:04:45.680 --> 00:05:05.920]   Well it's about time! And you know what else? While I was on hold, I found ANOTHER letter from you people threatening to cancel my policy. Do you know what that would do to my family if something happened to me?
                [00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:15.440]   I assure you we won't let your policy lapse while we resolve this. I see here that the original payment was flagged for review because...
                [00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:35.680]   Flagged for review? What does that even mean? I've been making the same payment, from the same account, on the same day, for FIFTEEN YEARS! What suddenly needs to be reviewed?
                [00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:50.240]   Our system flagged it because there was a banking routing number update in our system. However, I can see this was an error on our end...
                [00:05:50.240 --> 00:06:10.480]   An error on your end? Well, isn't that just perfect! So you're admitting it's your fault! I want compensation for all this trouble. All these fees, all this time I've wasted. Who's going to make this right?
                [00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:25.920]   I understand, Mr. Johnson. I can submit a request for fee reimbursement to our claims department. They typically review these cases within 5-7 business days...
                [00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:45.160]   5-7 business days? MORE waiting? This is outrageous! I want to speak to someone who can fix this TODAY. Get me your supervisor!
                [00:06:45.160 --> 00:07:00.480]   I understand you'd like to speak with a supervisor. Unfortunately, they're all in a department meeting right now. I can have one call you back within...
                [00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:20.720]   No! No more callbacks! The last supervisor never called! The one before that gave me the runaround! I'm not hanging up until this is resolved!
                [00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:35.360]   I hear your frustration, Mr. Johnson. While we wait for a supervisor to become available, I can at least start the reimbursement paperwork. Would that be helpful?
                [00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:55.600]   More paperwork? Let me guess - that'll take another 30 days to process? Meanwhile, I'm out almost $60 in fees, hours of my time, and still getting threatening letters!
                [00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:15.840]   I'll mark this as urgent in our system, Mr. Johnson. I can also send an immediate notice to our communications department to stop any automated letters while we resolve this.
                [00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:35.080]   You know what? I've been with your company for 15 years. Never missed a payment. Never caused any problems. And this is how I'm treated? Maybe I should just take my business elsewhere!
                [00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:50.320]   We truly value your loyalty, Mr. Johnson. I'm doing everything I can to resolve this. Let me check one more time if a supervisor is available.
                [00:08:50.320 --> 00:09:10.560]   Go ahead, check. But I'm telling you right now, if this isn't fixed today, I'm calling my lawyer. And I'm going to tell everyone I know about how this company treats its loyal customers!
                [00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:25.920]   I understand, sir. Please hold just one moment while I check.
                [00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:45.160]   [Brief hold]
                [00:09:45.160 --> 00:10:00.400]   Mr. Johnson, I've just been informed that all our supervisors are still unavailable. I can make sure you're first on the callback list...
                [00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:15.640]   That's it! I'm done! Absolutely done! You'll be hearing from my lawyer! [sound of phone slamming]

        [00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.040]   Thank you for calling Southern Farm Bureau Life Insurance.
        [00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.640]   This is Rachel speaking. How may I help you?
        [00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:13.880]   Hi Rachel, I need to update some information on my uncle's policy. He's been helping with my kids' college funds.
        [00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.240]   I'd be happy to help. May I have the policy number?
        [00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.960]   Yes, it's 49275. His name is William Chen.
        [00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.320]   Thank you. And may I have your name?
        [00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:45.760]   Michael Chen. Uncle Will's been mentoring me on financial planning. He suggested I help manage his policies since I'm in finance.
        [00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:52.480]   I understand. What information needs to be updated?
        [00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:02.320]   We're updating his estate planning. He'd like to increase his coverage and modify some beneficiaries.
        [00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:12.640]   I can help with that. I see this is a universal life policy with a current value of $175,000.
        [00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:22.880]   That's right. He'd like to increase it to $300,000 given the current estate tax thresholds.
        [00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:32.320]   We can discuss that. First, do you have authorization to make changes to the policy?
        [00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:45.760]   Yes, he added me as an authorized contact last month. He's semi-retired now, so I'm helping organize everything.
        [00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:55.440]   Perfect, I do see that here. What changes would you like to make to the beneficiaries?
        [00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:10.880]   He wants to add my kids to the policy - splitting it four ways instead of two. College is getting expensive.
        [00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:20.320]   I understand. We'll need your uncle to sign the beneficiary change form. I can email that today.
        [00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:35.640]   Actually, could you send it to my email? It's mchen@firstcapital.com. I handle his paperwork.
        [00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:45.280]   The policy shows a different contact email. Has that changed?
        [00:02:45.280 --> 00:03:05.440]   Yes, he rarely checks that one now. I've been managing his correspondence since he started traveling more.
        [00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:15.680]   For the coverage increase, we'll need to update some financial information. Is he available for a call?
        [00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:35.240]   He's actually in Singapore right now - big time difference. But I have all his information here. He's very thorough.
        [00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:45.520]   We'll still need him to complete some parts of the application. When does he return?
        [00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:55.840]   His schedule's flexible. What if we start with just the beneficiary changes? That's the priority.
        [00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:05.120]   Of course. The form will need to be notarized. Should I mail it to the address on file?
        [00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:35.360]   Better send it to my office: 2200 Market Street, Suite 1450. Our corporate notary can handle it.
        [00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:45.680]   What's your relationship with the current beneficiaries?
        [00:04:45.680 --> 00:05:05.920]   My sister and I are the current beneficiaries. We want to add my kids: Amy, age 16, and Jason, age 14.
        [00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:15.440]   And would this be an equal split between all four beneficiaries?
        [00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:35.680]   Yes, 25% each. Once that's done, we can discuss the coverage increase. He's very interested in estate planning vehicles.
        [00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:50.240]   I'll prepare those forms. Is there a good contact number for your uncle once he's back?
        [00:05:50.240 --> 00:06:10.480]   Just use my cell: 555-0182. I coordinate his schedule. Did you need his social security number again?
        [00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:25.920]   No, we have that on file. I'll send the forms today. Anything else I can help with?
        [00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:45.160]   That's all for now. I'll watch for those forms. Uncle Will's going to be so pleased we're getting this done.
        [00:06:45.160 --> 00:07:00.480]   Glad I could help. Please let us know when he's back so we can discuss the coverage increase.
        [00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.480]   Will do. Thanks Rachel.";

                [00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.640]   This is Amanda speaking. How can I help you today?
                [00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:13.880]   Hi, I'm calling about adding an indexed universal life rider to my current policy.
                [00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.240]   Oh... um, could I have your policy number please?
                [00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.960]   Sure, it's 45721. My name is David Martinez.
                [00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.320]   Um, let me pull that up for you... one moment please.
                [00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:45.760]   While you're looking, I've been reading about how these riders can help with market participation while maintaining downside protection. The S&P 500 index option looks interesting.
                [00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:52.480]   I... well... I see your policy here. It's a whole life policy with a face value of $250,000.
                [00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:02.320]   Right, and I'd like to explore adding the indexed component. I understand there's a cap rate and participation rate we should discuss?
                [00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:12.640]   Um... let me see... I'm not seeing anything about index options in my system...
                [00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:22.880]   Really? Your website specifically mentions indexed universal life options. Are you familiar with how they work?
                [00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:32.320]   Well... we do have different types of policies... maybe I should transfer you to someone else...
                [00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:45.760]   Before you transfer me, could you at least tell me what the current participation rate is? And whether you offer a fixed account option alongside the indexed account?
                [00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:55.440]   I'm... not really sure about those terms. Let me try to find someone in our advanced products department.
                [00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:10.880]   Okay, but please make sure they understand indexed products. This is the third time I've called, and no one seems able to explain the options.
                [00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:20.320]   I apologize for not being more helpful. Please hold while I transfer you.
                [00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:35.640]   [Hold music plays]
                [00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:45.280]   Mr. Martinez? This is Brian from Advanced Products. I understand you're interested in indexed universal life options?
                [00:02:45.280 --> 00:03:05.440]   Yes, finally! I've been researching this for weeks. Can you tell me about your current cap rates and if you offer any multiplier benefits?
                [00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:15.680]   Of course. Our current cap rate is 9.5% on the S&P 500 index strategy, and we do offer a 40% multiplier benefit after year 10.
                [00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:35.240]   That's helpful. What about the fixed account option? And do you offer any uncapped index strategies?
                [00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:45.520]   The fixed account currently credits 3.85%, and yes, we have an uncapped strategy with a 45% participation rate.
                [00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:55.840]   This is exactly what I've been trying to learn about. Why didn't the previous agents know any of this?
                [00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:05.120]   I apologize for the confusion earlier. You're right - we need to provide better training on our indexed products.
                [00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:35.360]   I appreciate your help, but it's concerning that basic product information isn't widely understood. I had to wait through three transfers.
                [00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:45.680]   You make a valid point. Would you like me to explain how we could add an indexed universal life component to your coverage?
                [00:04:45.680 --> 00:05:05.920]   Yes, please. And can you email me those rates and terms we discussed? My email is dmartinez@email.com.
                [00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:15.440]   Absolutely. I'll send that right over. Now, regarding your current policy, we have a few options...
                [00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:35.680]   Actually, before we get into that, what's the minimum participation amount? And is there a cap on how much I can allocate to the indexed account?
                [00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:50.240]   The minimum is $15,000 for the indexed account, and you can allocate up to 100% of your net premium after fees.
                [00:05:50.240 --> 00:06:10.480]   Good to know. My policy anniversary is coming up on April 15th. Would that be a good time to make these changes?
                [00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:25.920]   Yes, that would be ideal. We can process the changes then to align with your policy year. Would you like to schedule a follow-up call to complete the paperwork?
                [00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:45.160]   Sure, but please note in my file to have an advanced products person handle it. I don't want to explain indexed universal life again.
                [00:06:45.160 --> 00:07:00.480]   I understand completely. I'll handle your case personally. Is next Tuesday at 2 PM good for you?
                [00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:20.720]   That works. Please include the surrender periods and any transaction fees in that email too.
                [00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:35.360]   I'll provide a comprehensive breakdown of all fees and terms. Is there anything else you need clarification on?
                [00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:45.600]   No, that covers it. Just make sure someone knowledgeable calls next Tuesday.
                [00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:55.840]   I'll handle the call personally, Mr. Martinez. You'll have my direct extension in the email.
                [00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.840]   Thanks. Goodbye.";

        [00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.640]   This is Patricia speaking. How may I assist you today?
        [00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:13.880]   Hi Patricia, I hope you can help me sort this out. I've been trying to resolve a really complicated situation with our family's policies.
        [00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.240]   I'll certainly try my best. Could you start with your name and a policy number?
        [00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:30.960]   I'm Jennifer Anderson. The main policy number is 63492, but there are actually four policies involved here. The others are 63493, 63494, and 71285.
        [00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.320]   Thank you, Ms. Anderson. Could you walk me through what's happening?
        [00:00:35.320 --> 00:01:05.760]   Well, it's a bit of a mess. My parents, Robert and Mary Anderson, originally had the first three policies. Dad passed away in January, and while we were sorting that out, we discovered Mom had a separate policy, the 71285 one. We started the claims process for Dad's policies, but then we found some beneficiary paperwork that I think was never properly filed from 2021.
        [00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:15.480]   I'm very sorry for your loss. Let me look up the status of all these policies. Could you confirm your father's date of passing?
        [00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:25.320]   January 12th, 2024. We submitted the death certificate on January 20th.
        [00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:45.640]   I see that here. I'm showing three policies: a $100,000 whole life policy, a $250,000 term policy, and a $75,000 universal life policy for your father. And your mother's policy is a $50,000 whole life policy?
        [00:01:45.640 --> 00:02:00.880]   That's right. The whole life policy was from 1985, the term policy from 1995, and he added the universal life one in 2002. Mom's policy is from 1989.
        [00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:15.320]   Thank you. Now, you mentioned some beneficiary paperwork from 2021?
        [00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:45.760]   Yes. In October 2021, Dad tried to update the beneficiaries. I found the copy when cleaning out his desk. It was supposed to split everything between Mom, me, and my brother Michael. But when we filed the claim, they said Mom was still the only beneficiary on all three policies.
        [00:02:45.760 --> 00:03:00.480]   Let me check our records for any beneficiary change requests. Do you have the form he submitted?
        [00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:25.640]   Yes, I scanned it and emailed it to claims@sfbli.com on February 3rd. The reference number they gave me was BCF-2024-1832. It has Dad's signature and was notarized by Linda Martinez on October 15, 2021.
        [00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:35.320]   I see the email. Give me a moment to review this and check our processing records.
        [00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:45.480]   While you're checking, there's actually another complication with Mom's policy.
        [00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.240]   What's happening with her policy?
        [00:03:50.240 --> 00:04:20.660]   Well, she's moving into assisted living next month, and we need to change her premium payments. They were coming from a joint account with Dad, but we're setting up a new account for her. Plus, the premium notice from last month showed a different amount than what we're used to - it went up by $23.45.
        [00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:35.840]   Let me look at the premium history. Yes, I see the increase. That's because the policy entered a new age band in December.
        [00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:55.320]   Nobody told us it would increase. And actually, looking at my notes, Dad's universal life policy also had a premium change last year that we never understood.
        [00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:10.480]   I can explain both changes. But first, regarding the beneficiary form from 2021 - I'm showing it was received but there was an issue.
        [00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.720]   What kind of issue?
        [00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:45.880]   The form was incomplete. Section C, which designates the percentage split between beneficiaries, wasn't filled out. We sent a letter requesting clarification on November 3rd, 2021, to your father's address at 742 Maple Drive.
        [00:05:45.880 --> 00:06:05.240]   Oh no... they moved from Maple Drive to Oak Lane in November 2021. The letter must have never reached them. What do we do now?
        [00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:25.640]   Since your mother is still the sole beneficiary, she has options. She could either keep the proceeds or execute a disclaimer of benefits, which would allow the funds to pass to the contingent beneficiaries.
        [00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:45.320]   Who are the contingent beneficiaries? I don't think we even know.
        [00:06:45.320 --> 00:07:00.480]   Let me check... On the whole life policy, you and your brother are listed as contingent beneficiaries from the original 1985 policy application.
        [00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:15.720]   What about the other policies?
        [00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:45.880]   The term policy lists only your mother, with no contingents. The universal life policy lists your mother as primary and your brother Michael as sole contingent - this was updated in 2015.
        [00:07:45.880 --> 00:08:05.240]   That's odd - why would Dad have listed only Michael? There must be some mistake.
        [00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:25.640]   I'm looking at the 2015 form now. It's signed by your father and properly notarized. Would you like me to send you a copy?
        [00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:45.320]   Yes, please. My email is jen.anderson@email.com. This is all so confusing. Can we go back to Mom's policy for a minute?
        [00:08:45.320 --> 00:09:00.480]   Of course. You mentioned changing her premium payments and had a question about the increase?
        [00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:30.720]   Right. We need to set up automatic payments from her new account. It's at First National, routing number 091000019, account 84752913. The premiums are due on the 15th, but since she's moving to assisted living on the 10th, can we change the draft date?
        [09:30.720 --> 00:09:45.880]   We can adjust the draft date. What day would you prefer?
        [09:45.880 --> 00:10:05.240]   The 20th would be better. Her Social Security and pension deposits will hit the account by then. But what about this premium increase? Will it go up again?
        [00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:35.640]   The premium increase was due to the age band change at 75. Looking ahead, there will be another small increase at age 80. As for your father's universal life policy premium change that you mentioned earlier, that was due to the crediting rate adjustment that affected the cost of insurance.
        [00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:55.320]   I don't understand. Dad never mentioned any crediting rate changes.
        [00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:15.480]   The universal life policy's premiums can vary based on interest rates and policy performance. Would you like me to send you the last annual statement that explains this?
        [00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:45.720]   Yes, please. And what about the claims process now? Mom's willing to follow Dad's wishes from the 2021 form, even though it wasn't processed. She wants to split everything three ways like he intended.
        [00:11:45.720 --> 00:12:05.880]   We have several options. Your mother can either:
        1. Accept the benefits and then gift portions to you and your brother
        2. File a disclaimer of benefits
        3. Or establish a trust

        [00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:25.240]   What's involved in the disclaimer? And would there be tax implications?
        [00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:55.640]   A disclaimer needs to be filed within 9 months of death and is irrevocable. Your mother would need to disclaim her interest in writing, without accepting any benefit. The proceeds would then pass to contingent beneficiaries according to each policy's designations.
        [00:12:55.640 --> 00:13:15.320]   But the policies have different contingent beneficiaries, so that won't achieve what Dad wanted.
        [00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:45.480]   Correct. Given the different contingent beneficiary designations, a disclaimer might not achieve the desired distribution. Your mother might want to consult with a tax advisor about the gift option.
        [00:13:45.480 --> 00:14:05.720]   This is overwhelming. Can we start with just updating Mom's premium payment information while we figure out the rest?
        [00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:25.880]   Of course. I'll help you with that now. We'll need a completed EFT authorization form. I can email that to you.
        [00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:45.240]   Great. And could you also send me information about the disclaimer process and gift options?
        [00:14:45.240 --> 00:15:15.640]   Yes, I'll include those materials. I'm also noting in the file that you're gathering information about death benefit distribution options. Would you like me to place a 30-day hold on the claim processing to give you time to consult with advisors?
        [00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:35.320]   Yes, please. Mom's meeting with her accountant next week anyway. Oh, and what address do you show for Mom now?
        [00:15:35.320 --> 00:16:05.480]   I show 1842 Oak Lane. Will that be changing with her move to assisted living?
        [00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:35.720]   Yes, it will be Magnolia Gardens Assisted Living, 555 Elder Way, Apartment 304, Jackson, MS 39201. The move is scheduled for March 10th.
        [00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:55.880]   I'll note the future address change in the system. Would you like me to summarize everything we've discussed and the next steps?
        [00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:25.240]   Please do. I've been taking notes but want to make sure I haven't missed anything.
        [00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:55.640]   I'll outline the key points and action items:

        1. Death Claims Status:
        - Three policies for Robert Anderson
        - 30-day hold placed on processing
        - Options for distribution to be discussed with tax advisor

        2. Mom's Policy Updates:
        - Premium payment changing to new bank account
        - Draft date moving to the 20th
        - Address change scheduled for March 10th

        3. Documents I'm Sending to jen.anderson@email.com:
        - EFT authorization form
        - Disclaimer information
        - Gift transfer options
        - 2015 beneficiary designation
        - Universal life policy annual statement

        [00:17:55.640 --> 00:18:15.320]   Perfect. And this is all being noted in the file so I don't have to explain everything again if I need to call back?
        [00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:45.480]   Yes, I'm documenting our complete conversation under reference number CSR-2024-7456. Is there anything else you need help with today?
        [00:18:45.480 --> 00:19:05.720]   No, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you for your patience in explaining all of this.
        [00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:25.880]   You're welcome. Please don't hesitate to call back if you have any questions after reviewing the materials I'm sending.
        [00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:35.240]   Thank you. Goodbye.
        [00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.240]   Goodbye, Ms. Anderson.";

        [00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.640]   This is Rebecca speaking. How may I assist you today?
        [00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:15.880]   Hi Rebecca, I'm calling about converting my term policy. I got a letter saying I should consider it since I'm turning 65 this year.
        [00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.240]   I'll be happy to help you with that. First, may I have your policy number?
        [00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.960]   It's 82547.
        [00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.320]   And could you verify your name for me?
        [00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.760]   Thomas Richardson.
        [00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:45.480]   Thank you, Mr. Richardson. For security purposes, could you also verify your date of birth?
        [00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.320]   Sure, it's July 15th, 1959.
        [00:00:50.320 --> 00:01:10.640]   Perfect, thank you. I see you have a 20-year term policy that was issued in 2004 with a face amount of $500,000. The conversion option does need to be exercised before your 65th birthday, so your timing is good.
        [00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:25.320]   Yes, that's why I'm calling. The letter mentioned something about not needing a medical exam if I convert now?
        [00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:55.640]   That's correct. One of the benefits of converting is that you don't need to go through underwriting again. You can convert all or part of your coverage to permanent insurance, and your rates will be based on your age when the original policy was issued, which was 45. Would you like me to explain the different permanent policy options available?
        [00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:10.880]   Yes, please. I'm not really sure about the differences between them.
        [00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:45.440]   I'll be happy to explain. You have three main options. First is whole life, which has level premiums that never increase and builds cash value at a guaranteed rate. Second is universal life, which offers more flexibility with premium payments and death benefit amounts. Third is indexed universal life, which allows for potential higher cash value growth tied to market performance but with downside protection.
        [00:02:45.440 --> 00:03:05.320]   That's a lot to take in. The letter mentioned my term premium is going to increase to over $600 a month if I don't convert. Is that right?
        [00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:35.640]   Yes, that's correct. Your current premium of $127 per month was guaranteed for the 20-year term period. If you keep the term policy after it expires, the premium would increase to $615 monthly, and it would continue to increase each year. With conversion, while the initial premium would be higher than your current term rate, it would remain level.
        [00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:50.880]   What would the premium be if I converted to whole life?
        [00:03:50.880 --> 00:04:20.440]   Let me calculate that for you... For a $500,000 whole life policy, the premium would be $486 per month. This includes a dividend option that could potentially reduce your out-of-pocket cost over time. Would you like me to also show you the universal life options for comparison?
        [00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:35.320]   Yes, but first - can I convert just part of it? Maybe $300,000 instead of the full amount?
        [00:04:35.320 --> 00:05:05.640]   Absolutely. Let me recalculate... For $300,000 of whole life coverage, the premium would be $291.60 per month. For universal life, it would be $268.40, and for indexed universal life, it would start at $285.75. The universal life options could have lower premiums initially, but they're not guaranteed to remain level like the whole life premium.
        [00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:25.880]   And what happens to the other $200,000? Can I keep that as term for now?
        [00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:55.440]   Yes, you could keep the remaining $200,000 as term coverage until the end of your term period, but the premium for that portion would increase to $246 monthly after the term period expires. Some clients choose to convert in stages to make the premium increase more manageable. Would you like me to show you some examples of different conversion strategies?
        [00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:15.320]   That might be helpful. Also, does the conversion affect my beneficiary designation?
        [00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:45.640]   Your current beneficiary is your wife, Mary Richardson, with your children James and Sarah as contingent beneficiaries. This designation would carry over to the converted policy automatically, but you can also make changes during the conversion process if you'd like. Would you like me to email you illustrations showing different conversion options?
        [00:06:45.640 --> 00:07:00.880]   Yes, please. It's tom.richardson@email.com
        [00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:30.440]   Thank you. I'll prepare illustrations showing three scenarios: full conversion to whole life, partial conversion with retained term, and a staged conversion plan. I'll also include information about the dividend options and loan provisions. The illustrations should arrive within the next hour. Would you like to schedule a follow-up call to review them?
        [00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:45.320]   Yes, that would be good. What's your availability next week?
        [00:07:45.320 --> 00:08:15.640]   I have openings next Tuesday at 10 AM or 2 PM, or Wednesday afternoon between 1 and 4. The review typically takes about 30 minutes. We can go through all the numbers and I can answer any questions about the different policies. Which time works best for you?
        [00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:25.880]   Tuesday at 2 PM would work.
        [00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:55.440]   Perfect, I'll schedule that now. Is the best number to reach you still 555-0123? Also, would you like your wife to join the call since she's the primary beneficiary? Many clients find it helpful to have their spouse involved in these discussions.
        [00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:15.320]   Yes, that's still my number. And yes, I'll have Mary join us. She'll have questions too, I'm sure.
        [00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:45.640]   Excellent. I'll note that in the appointment. You'll receive a confirmation email with the illustrations and appointment details. One last thing - would you like me to have our local agent, Bill Matthews, join the call as well? He can provide additional insights about how these policies fit into your overall financial planning.
        [00:09:45.640 --> 00:10:00.880]   Yes, that would be helpful. We've worked with Bill before.
        [00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:30.440]   Great, I'll coordinate with Bill. To summarize: I'll send illustrations to your email today, and we'll have a conference call next Tuesday at 2 PM with you, Mary, Bill, and myself to review everything in detail. Is there anything else you need information about before then?
        [00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:45.320]   No, I think that covers it. Thank you for your help.
        [00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:55.640]   You're welcome, Mr. Richardson. Have a great day, and we'll talk on Tuesday.
        [00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:00.880]   Thanks, goodbye.
        [00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.880]   Goodbye.";
